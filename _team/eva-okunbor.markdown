Eva Okunbor is OpenOwnership’s Programme Associate and is responsible for directly supporting implementation and delivery in all countries within which OpenOwnership is active. Eva is also an essential link between OpenOwnership and its partners, most notably the Open Government Partnership, having coordinated the first group of countries to sign up to the co-convened Beneficial Ownership Leadership Group.

As a former Transparency International staffer, her broad experience in transparency issues has given her skills in project management, research, and training that are regularly deployed across OpenOwnership’s work streams.

British-born, with family from Nigeria Eva holds a BSc in International Relations from the London School of Economics. She speaks English, French and Spanish and has travelled extensively, with her notebook packed with poems and commentary on the places and people she has met.
