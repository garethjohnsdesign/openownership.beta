Simon Whitehouse works for OpenOwnership’s technical partner, Open Data Services Co-operative. He provides OpenOwnership with technical support, leads on the translation work of the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard and supports the development of our data collection tools.

In local government Simon worked on community projects, such as being the technical lead on a community wireless network covering Aston, Birmingham. He also led the city’s early work on open data publication, a role that covered both technical and policy work.

As a freelancer, he was the series lead for the Open Data Institute's inaugural Open Data Challenge focusing on Crime and Justice. This combined his professional open data work with his interest in the criminal justice system, having spent fifteen years supporting Samaritan’s Listener programmes in prison.

Simon has a BSc in Computing and Mathematical Science and a Post Graduate Diploma in Computing for Commerce and Industry, both from Open University, UK. From, and still living in, Birmingham, he has recently spent a couple of years in Latin America, principally in Colombia. He speaks Spanish to an intermediate level (according to his more polite Spanish-speaking friends).
