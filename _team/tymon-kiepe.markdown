Tymon Kiepe is OpenOwnership's Policy and Research Manager. He leads the research agenda to help the team collectively develop, test, and refine OpenOwnership’s policy recommendations and tools, while also supporting governments in implementing beneficial ownership transparency.

He has spent his career bringing research and evidence to bear on policy in the development sector. Before joining OpenOwnership, he worked at the Netherlands’ leading think tank on international affairs, the Clingendael Institute, and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, facilitating the uptake of research into policy processes.

Tymon's focus has mostly been on Sub-Saharan Africa, where his interest in beneficial ownership grew from seeing how anonymously owned companies and the international financial system enable illicit financial flows from resource-rich conflict-affected countries.

He is a graduate of Utrecht University (UCU) in the Netherlands and the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) at the University of London. In his spare time he can usually be found on – or tinkering with – a bicycle.
