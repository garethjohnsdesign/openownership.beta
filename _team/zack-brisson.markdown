As OpenOwnership’s Chief Operating Officer, Zack Brisson keeps us in good working order. He is experienced in building teams with diverse backgrounds and skill sets to challenge received wisdom and think outside the box when it comes to driving public sector reform. Zack was an early believer in putting citizens and user feedback at the heart of development. In 2010 he founded Reboot, a pioneering think-do tank focused on delivering citizen led progress on critical public issues. Having built a team of nearly thirty members working across multiple offices, he oversaw dozens of projects in more than twenty-five countries.

This work spanned everything from developing social protection programs in Nigeria to leading criminal justice reform initiatives in New York City, with countless other stops in between. For Zack, OpenOwnership provides the perfect opportunity to take a deeper focus on the specific issue of beneficial ownership, while also helping build another new social enterprise.

Earlier in his career, Zack worked on various aspects of governance, starting in journalism and then onto frontline policy advocacy during the Obama administration where he worked on a diverse set of issues ranging from human rights in sub-Saharan Africa to domestic US environmental issues, such as the Deep Water Horizon oil spill.

Zack has spoken at TEDex Tunis, Slush, academic events and lectures, and taught at high schools and universities from ‘how to’ speeches on social enterprises and doing development differently, to more general talks on international relations and history. He studied the History of Globalisation at the College of William and Mary and has lectured at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Columbia, MIT and Rutgers.

Zack is a utilitarian who enjoys watching political satire, reading graphic novels, building lego and a fine debate over even finer food. Zack is US-born, has worked in more than forty countries and splits his time between the US and Europe.
