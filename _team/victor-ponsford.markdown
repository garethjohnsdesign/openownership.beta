Victor Ponsford is OpenOwnership’s Advocacy and Communications Specialist. He drives our mission forward by raising our visibility and spreading our ideas via innovative channels and creative content strategies.

Vic has spent his career helping organisations find and use their voice. As a Communications Officer with the EITI (Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative), he tracked and communicated on the impact of one of the world’s first transparency initiatives.

Vic’s interest in beneficial ownership was first sparked by reports of billions of dollars flowing from the developing to the developed world. Then the Panama and Paradise Papers broke and it became clear that hidden companies were at the heart of this and many other corruption scandals.

British-born and raised in China, Russia, Botswana and Tajikistan, he now lives in Oslo, Norway where he is slowly learning Norwegian. Vic is a graduate of SOAS (School of Oriental and African Studies), where he wrote his thesis on diamond mining in Botswana.
