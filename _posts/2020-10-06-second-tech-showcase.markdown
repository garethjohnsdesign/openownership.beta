On 01 October 2020 Open Ownership held our second technology showcase – an
online webinar hosting talks by speakers from government, civil society, and the
private sector – demonstrating technology working with beneficial ownership (BO)
data. Featuring speakers from Companies House, Denmark's CVR, UNODC, GLEIF, EITI
and Directorio Legislativo we discussed projects, ranging from international
identifiers to anti-money laundering tools and national company registers.

The session was recorded and we are pleased to share the video for those who
could not make it:

We had two main themes this time around: national registers serving free, open
data and AML tools. We approached these from several different angles. Steve
Bowen from the UK's Companies House discussed their hosting infrastructure and
the history of their initial move to Amazon's cloud services, followed by their
subsequent shift to the London region because of Brexit. Peter Niebling from
Denmark's CVR then explained the impact of their equivalent move from a packaged
data seller, to a free public source of open data.

We found both of these talks really interesting as they both highlighted some of
the unexpected benefits of offering free public data, and made the scale of such
systems more comprehensible.

On the AML front, GLEIF gave an introduction to their system for uniquely
identifying legal entities and then demonstrated how their data on entity
structures can help in anti-money laundering investigations. Antoine Karam from
UNODC then gave us another view on these investigations with a talk about their
goAML product, used by Financial Investigation Units around the world. His
insights into the potential future of collaborative investigations were
extremely valuable.

Finally, Catherine Greene and Noel Alonso-Murray from EITI and Directorio
Legislativo gave us a preview of the anti-corruption tool they've been building
for the IMF iLab competition. They didn't mention it in their talk, but the [live
pitch event](https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/innovation-at-the-imf/imf-acc-event)
for this competition is happening on the 7th of October, 10:15 – 12:00pm EST
where Catherine and Noel will officially pitch their project for the IMF's
continued support and where you can vote to help them succeed. We think this
project is a great example of the potential in linking different transparency
disclosures together to uncover corruption.
