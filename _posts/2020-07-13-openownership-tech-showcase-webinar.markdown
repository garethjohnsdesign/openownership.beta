*Join the OpenOwnership tech team for our first 'Technology Showcase' event on 30th July 2020.*

We're inviting partners and anyone else working on digital transparency tools to join us to share updates and learning through a series of lightning talks. The focus of the event will be on projects that work on digital tools concerned with the transparency of company ownership and control.

[Register now as an attendee.](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_dvtzWNk5Sv66p1pD54RAdw)

Confirmed speakers so far include: mySociety, OCCRP, the Sinar Project and YouControl.

The OpenOwnership team will also be taking part to share recent developments, including a first look at the beta Beneficial Ownership Visualisation System and demonstrating an end-to-end prototype for taking beneficial ownership disclosure from paper forms, through spreadsheets, to structured data and diagrams.

The session will end with space for Q&A, community notices, and informal networking break-outs.

This first session will take place in English and will be recorded. We’ll make the recording available later for those who can’t make it in person.
