During the Open Gov Week 2021, Open Ownership will be participating in an Open Government Partnership (OGP) and EITI (Extractive Industries Transparency Initative) high-level engagement on advancing beneficial ownership transparency in Africa. The event will convene leaders from government, civil society, public and private sectors. 

These leaders will share best practice guidance on instituting beneficial ownership reform infrastructure to enhance its effectiveness and impact and ultimately mitigate corruption and mismanagement in the natural resource sector, as well as supporting governments in adapting to new challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
