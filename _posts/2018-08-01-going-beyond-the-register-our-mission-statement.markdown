Our founding organizations came together because of a shared vision: freely accessible, linked beneficial ownership information for the benefit of both business and society.

Since then, we’ve talked to partners around the world - in civil society, business, and government. We’ve learned that there’s a lot more work to be done where the rubber meets the road. How do governments transform political commitment into implementation with genuine impact? How can civil society and business users take existing information and change the world?

So we’re stepping up. Over the next two years, we’ll be focusing on practical interventions to change behaviours and standards so that publishing beneficial ownership data becomes the norm, not the exception.

It still seems like yesterday to us, but almost fifteen months have passed since we launched the beta version of the [world’s first global beneficial ownership register](https://register.openownership.org/). Today, we’re delighted to celebrate a new landmark: OpenOwnership’s first Mission Statement.

Even as we expand our activity, our commitment remains the same - to drive greater corporate transparency across the world by making it easy to publish and access high-quality, linked data about who owns companies.

But the Mission Statement also articulates our vision, strategic priorities and the key goals we want to achieve by 2020 as we continue to grow our team, network, and (of course) the Register to meet the opportunities and challenges ahead.

Our Mission Statement is available to read and download in our resources section [here](https://openownership.org/uploads/Open%20Ownership%20Mission%20Statement%202018.pdf).

We’re excited to embark on this next phase of the OpenOwnership journey and look forward to continuing to work with our partners and stakeholders to realise our 2020 goals. If you would like to hear more about our work, you can get involved by:
