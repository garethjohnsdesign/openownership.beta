A new joint programme between Open Ownership (OO) and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), supported by the BHP Foundation, aims to end the use of anonymous companies linked to corruption and mismanagement in natural resources. 

OO and the EITI today launched **Opening Extractives**, a global programme to advance beneficial ownership transparency. It aims to make a transformational impact in the amount of publicly available information on the owners of extractive companies. 

The extractive sector is at acute risk of corruption due to the often significant revenues stemming from these public assets. Anonymous companies have too often facilitated corruption in the sector, as revealed in a series of scandals from the 2016 Panama Papers to the 2020 Launda Leaks. 

Research carried out last year by OO and the EITI has shown there is both [high demand for technical assistance to achieve beneficial ownership transparency](https://www.openownership.org/blogs/opening-extractives-research-informs-programme-to-make-beneficial-ownership-transparency-a-reality-in-oil-gas-and-mining/), and a need for tailored support to address the complex dynamics that give rise to reform. 

The programme will be partly funded by the BHP Foundation and delivered by OO and the EITI International Secretariat.
