We also have limited space for additional speakers, so if you would like to give a 5-10 minute lightening talk about a product or service, please [drop our team an email](mailto:tech@openownership.org)

The session will end with space for Q&A, community notices, and informal networking break-outs. As with the first session, this will take place in English and will be recorded. We’ll make the recording available later for those who can’t make it in person.
