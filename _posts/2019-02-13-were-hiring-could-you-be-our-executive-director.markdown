OpenOwnership is dedicated to increasing corporate transparency across the world by making it easy to publish and access high-quality data about who owns companies. Anonymous shell companies enable corruption, fraud, organised crime and tax evasion. The wider the access to high quality data on who owns what, the harder it will be for corrupt individuals to hide.

The organisation was established by multiple civil society and private sector stakeholders as a part of their collective efforts to tackle corruption, money laundering and illicit financial flows. As the momentum behind beneficial ownership has grown, and many governments now committed to implementing public registers, OpenOwnership has recognised the opportunity to expand its mandate and impact.

We are now seeking our first Executive Director, to move us to our next phase of development as we seek scale and impact for our cutting-edge work to end anonymous companies.

#### Executive Director
**Location: London**
**Salary: Circa £80,000 negotiable, depending on skills and experience**

The Executive Director will have overall responsibility for leading the organisation and delivering our new strategy, supported by a strong Steering Group and talented and committed staff team.

You will be the global face of OpenOwnership, responsible for growing our outreach, fundraising and partnerships and be very comfortable representing us externally on high level platforms. An excellent communicator with a high level of diplomacy, you bring experience of working in complex international and politicised environments, in particular working with government.

An experienced leader with hands-on operational abilities, you bring the entrepreneurial approach necessary to lead a small organisation with ambitious plans for furthering its impact.  Your ability to leverage existing networks and drive technical development will be essential, to enable OpenOwnership to make a significant contribution to establishing a global norm of beneficial ownership transparency.

An understanding of issues around corporate transparency, corruption and beneficial ownership is highly desirable, together with experience running campaigns or programmes in a similar field.

Candidates must have the right to work in the UK and be willing and able to travel internationally.
