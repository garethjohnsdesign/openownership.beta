# Episode 2: The Way That Business Is Run

The systems of offshore finance might seem like the remit of far flung exotic islands, but they are actually embedded deeply into our lives and woven through our everyday economy. Episode 2 of Where Power Lies, "The Way That Business Is Run", explores how and why that is, looking at the history of the offshore system and explaining why offshore is the biggest driver of wealth inequality in modern society. This episode also features an interview with Professor Ronen Palan, Professor of International Political Economy at City, University of London.

Join hosts Thom Townsend and Bridey Addison-Child as they explore where power really lies, and how we can hold it to account. In case you missed it, listen to Episode 1 of Where Power Lies, "Remember the Panama Papers", [here](https://anchor.fm/open-ownership).
