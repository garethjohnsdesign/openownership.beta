The coronavirus pandemic is and will continue to have the largest impact on public policy for years, possibly decades to come. Pre-existing weaknesses and issues in global governance, be they economic, social or political have become further exacerbated during the crisis. Beneficial ownership opacity - not knowing who owns and controls businesses - is a profound weak point that many countries are taking with them into this crisis.

The pro-trade and good governance imperative for publishing the owners of companies before the crisis is stronger and more urgent now. However, the ability of governments to deliver this reform may well be undermined as attention is understandably focussed on dealing with the public health crisis and its economic impact. 

OpenOwnership recently held an expert panel with leading representatives from government, industry, civil society, academia and the media to discuss how beneficial ownership transparency can contribute to tackling the crisis and why this important reform cannot be ignored.

Areas where beneficial ownership transparency is key: 

Governments are undertaking extensive emergency public procurement to meet public health needs, in public health needs, healthcare and are facing global shortages of key supplies such as PPE. Without adequate due diligence, governments can fall prey to fraud and counterfeiting schemes, as unscrupulous actors seek to take advantage of global shortages to meet urgent needs. 
Ownership transparency means that governments can quickly perform the most minimum standards of due diligence on companies they are buying goods and services from. As well as reducing immediate risk of corruption, it provides a valuable trail for future audit.
Many trillions of dollars is being pumped into economies around the world. A significant amount of this will go to companies that are receiving financial support as part of economic stimulus and wage protection packages. Without effective tracking, funds are at risk of diversion through corruption or mismanagement. 
Beneficial ownership transparency gives governments valuable information about who is ultimately benefiting from economic stimulus support provided to companies, and can be used to target support where need is greatest.
In addition to guarding against corruption and mismanagement, governments face the challenge of ensuring that financial support to companies strengthens the domestic economy; this has led countries such as Canada, Denmark and France to refuse financial support to companies based in tax havens. 
Ownership transparency can provide governments valuable information to understand where the owners of companies are based, for example for tax purposes
As attention turns to promoting economic recovery, governments will seek to position their countries to attract inward investment. Lack of transparency is recognised as a key risk factor for businesses deciding whether to invest. 
Ownership transparency means that everyone in the market can quickly understand who they are really trading with, assisting inward investment and reducing risk to businesses wishing to invest.

To help achieve these goals and in response to demand from countries and partners around the world, we have launched the new OpenOwnership Principles. The Principles define what good beneficial ownership transparency looks like in practice. They provide a framework for effective beneficial ownership transparency that will enable and empower governments to generate and use beneficial ownership data to address the wide range of integrity and governance challenges we face as the world navigates the COVID-19 pandemic.

In order to ensure the OpenOwnership’s policies, research, the Principles and wider technical assistance can assist with the response to Covid-19, we are issuing an open call to experts to join a new Advisory Group on Beneficial Ownership in Times of COVID-19. This panel will meet on a monthly basis to take stock of the developing situation around the coronavirus crisis, the political, social and economic implications relating to corporate transparency, and how OpenOwnership can help address these.
