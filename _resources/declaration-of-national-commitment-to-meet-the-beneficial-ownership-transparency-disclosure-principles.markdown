There has been a growing global momentum to develop a comprehensive framework to enhance beneficial ownership transparency. In November 2014, G20 Leaders adopted the High-Level Principles on Beneficial Ownership Transparency. The Leaders noted that “Improving the transparency of legal persons and arrangements is important to protect the integrity and transparency of the global financial system.” Subsequent commitments and actions, by individual countries, at the London Anti-Corruption Summit in 2016, via implementation of the European Union’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, and through endeavours such as the global Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) show a growing recognition of the importance of beneficial ownership transparency. As a group of countries, we will aim to build on this progress and create a new global norm of beneficial ownership transparency across asset classes. We believe that greater transparency of beneficial ownership will over time help to reduce the abuse of assets for criminal means.
