Delivering improved beneficial ownership transparency is a process that should
involve as many different groups as possible, from government officials to
citizens and businesses. This briefing draws on OpenOwnershipâ€™s experience
supporting almost 40 countries to advance beneficial ownership transparency.
Throughout this work we have gained insight into how consultation can be
delivered within different political, social and economic contexts. This briefing
provides government implementers and actors supporting reform with general
guidance on effective consultation approaches.
