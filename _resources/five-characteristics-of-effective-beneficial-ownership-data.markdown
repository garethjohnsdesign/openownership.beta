  This briefing outlines five characteristics of effective beneficial ownership data, which together help make published
   data easy to use, more accurate, and interoperable.

  These characteristics draw on established principles for
   publishing open data, and underpin OpenOwnership’s
   approach to beneficial ownership transparency. For each
  \
  characteristic, we make concrete recommendations for
   countries implementing beneficial ownership transparency. These are consistent with the Beneficial Ownership

  \
  Data Standard, which allows beneficial ownership data to
   be interoperable with data from other jurisdictions.
