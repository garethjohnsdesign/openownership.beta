The Beneficial Ownership Data Standard provides a way to organise information about companies and their beneficial owners. It means that if you publish data in this format others will easily be able to understand it and computer systems will be able to process it. You can think of BODS as template into which you can place beneficial ownership information. This presentation explains more about it.
