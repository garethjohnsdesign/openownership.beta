The Open Ownership Principles for effective beneficial ownership disclosure are designed to make
published data more easy to use, accurate, and interoperable. These have been
reached through OpenOwnershipâ€™s work developing the Beneficial Ownership Data
Standard and supporting almost 40 countries to advance beneficial ownership
transparency.
