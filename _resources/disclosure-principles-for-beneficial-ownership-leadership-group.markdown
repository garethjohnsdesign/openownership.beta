**Declaration of national commitment to meet the Beneficial Ownership Transparency Disclosure Principles**

A new global norm of beneficial ownership transparency

There has been a growing global momentum to develop a comprehensive framework to enhance beneficial ownership transparency. In November 2014, G20 Leaders adopted the High-Level Principles on Beneficial Ownership Transparency. The Leaders noted that “Improving the transparency of legal persons and arrangements is important to protect the integrity and transparency of the global financial system.” Subsequent commitments and actions, by individual countries, at the London Anti-Corruption Summit in 2016, via implementation of the European Union’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, and through endeavours such as the global Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) show a growing recognition of the importance of beneficial ownership transparency. As a group of countries, we will aim to build on this progress and create a new global norm of beneficial ownership transparency across asset classes. We believe that greater transparency of beneficial ownership will over time help to reduce the abuse of assets for criminal means.

Assets like corporate structures and trusts can and should be a force for good, and in the majority of cases across the globe they are. However, we know that companies and other legal entities can be abused to facilitate corruption, serious and organised crime, and tax evasion. Transnational by nature, these criminal activities generate real costs for markets and for people, and especially hurt the poorest in society.

Rebalancing markets and rebuilding trust between governments, companies, and everyday citizens will require an equal effort of transnational action on the part of governments. That is why we, as a group of countries, are united on the importance of the transparency of beneficial ownership information, promoted through ambitious implementation of existing international standards and initiatives and the build-up of emerging worldwide norms and best practice. Global illicit financial flows are channeled through a range of legal entities and assets including companies, trusts, properties and other high value commodities.

As a group of vanguard countries, we will collectively drive greater beneficial ownership transparency, including through free to access and publicly accessible registers, across a diverse range of countries and asset classes wherever possible. In the near term, to demonstrate tangible progress, our priority focus will be on creating a new global norm of beneficial ownership transparency for companies.

In order to end the criminal abuse of companies, the world needs efficient ways to share and access high-quality information about who owns and controls them. As leading governments committed to transparency, integrity, and open access to public sector information, we are working together to build a new global norm of accessible beneficial ownership information that is linked across borders. We expect the benefits of a new norm of beneficial ownership transparency will include:

- Enhancing our ability to fight corruption, money laundering and terrorist financing and other illicit financial flows as the risks of detection are significantly increased through better access to information by law enforcement and civil society, which acts as a deterrent.

- Improving the business environment through creating trust, levelling the playing field and promoting open competition including on public procurement and improving due diligence for traders and investors.

- Addressing tax evasion as tax authorities can better understand the interests of both corporate and individual taxpayers.

- Generating network effects, through sharing best practice and encouraging countries around the world to follow suit.

Our aims

As a group of vanguard countries, we will look to shift the global norms of company beneficial ownership transparency by 2023, by committing ourselves to developing domestic public registers of company beneficial ownership, support efforts globally and regionally for other countries to do the same and participate as members of a Beneficial Ownership Leadership Group (the Leadership Group). The Leadership Group will work towards ensuring official development assistance eligible countries[\[1\]](#_ftn1) receive technical and financial support to implement their own beneficial ownership transparency commitments.

The Leadership Group is a transnational coalition that will both drive a global policy shift towards free, open source publicly accessible beneficial ownership data for companies, and set ambitious international best practice on beneficial ownership transparency. Members are governments that are united by a common vision of simple access by business, civil society, and other government actors to public, open data of corporate beneficial ownership that is linked transnationally. The Leadership Group will be guided by a terms-of-reference and meet twice each year in the margins of international fora.
