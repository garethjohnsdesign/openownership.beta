The OpenOwnership Pilot Program supports national governments to establish open beneficial ownership registers that meets policy goals â€” from improving the business environment to tackling corruption and money laundering. It distinguishes itself from similar programs in that support is provided in-kind, and across the the range of policy and technical issues that are involved in publishing effective, high-quality data. 

This document outlines how the pilot program operates, the benefits of being involved, our priorities for selecting country partners, and the implementation journey through which we support governments to progress from commitment to effective implementation.
