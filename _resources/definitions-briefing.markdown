To maximise the impact of beneficial ownership (BO) registers, it is important to
minimise loopholes and make data as useful as possible. A legal definition of BO
and its associated thresholds form the foundation on which a disclosure regime
is built. This policy briefing aims to help policymakers and those implementing
or supporting BOT to think through the decisions required to define BO in law and
to set appropriate thresholds, and how to operationalise these.
