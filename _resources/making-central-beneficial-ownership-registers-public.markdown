This briefing outlines the benefits that arise from making a BO register public by looking at how different user groups are able to use the data when it is made public, and identifying the benefits this has. It argues that there is sufficient evidence for policymakers to act on the understanding that a public register will serve the public interest. It outlines key considerations for implementers and helps devise effective and safe BOT regimes appropriate for their contexts.
