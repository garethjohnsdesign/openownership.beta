Open Ownership is running a consultation on the Open Ownership Principles (OO Principles). The OO Principles define what effective beneficial ownership looks like in practice. The OO Principles focus on the technical characteristics of effective disclosure regimes, rather than on the external political, social, economic and cultural factors that are known to influence implementation and impact. 

Your submissions will help us assess:

* Whether the scope and detail of the principles is sufficient to act as an effective framework for a holistic and impactful implementation of beneficial ownership transparency regimes

* The utility of the Principles in various sectors working on beneficial ownership transparency, and new use cases

* How the principles can be leveraged to push for better beneficial ownership data, useful to a broad range of potential data users

* The risks and opportunities of the OO Principles as a global standard on beneficial ownership transparency, and how it fits with established global norms and standards

This open consultation will be supplemented by more detailed written and verbal feedback from a smaller group of expert stakeholders.

**Background
**

Governments are pursuing Beneficial Ownership Transparency (BOT) for a range of policy aims, including to tackle corruption, promote economic growth, and ensure effective taxation. To achieve these goals, governments must implement comprehensive transparent company ownership that generates actionable and usable data for a range of potential users, including law enforcement and journalists during investigations, civil society monitoring, and public and private sector due diligence.

In April 2020, Open Ownership (OO) launched the Principles for Effective Beneficial Ownership Disclosure, with the aim of setting the gold standard for good governance through transparency company ownership. These were originally 12 principles with over 100 detailed indicators. Over the course of the following nine months, OO worked with partners at the national and international level to test these principles, applying them in our work to support BOT in countries including [Armenia](https://www.openownership.org/uploads/armenia-scoping-report.pdf), [Mexico](https://www.openownership.org/blogs/mexico-laying-the-foundations-for-beneficial-ownership-transparency/), [Ghana, Kenya, and Nigeria](https://www.openownership.org/blogs/beneficial-ownership-reform-in-africa-progress-in-ghana-kenya-and-nigeria/).

In December 2020, OO published the refined and updated principles. The Open Ownership Principles (OO Principles). The OO Principles provide a framework for implementing comprehensive transparent company ownership that generates actionable and usable data. Effective disclosure needs high quality, reliable data to maximise usability and minimise loopholes.

The OO Principles focus on the technical characteristics of effective disclosure regimes, rather than on the external political, social, economic and cultural factors that are known to influence implementation and impact
The OO Principles are the product of OO’s work with almost 40 countries to advance BOT and break down the complexity in implementing it.
Implementing the OO Principles goes beyond the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations 24 and 25  that relating to the collection of beneficial ownership (BO) data by governments to counter money laundering and terrorism financing.

By using the OO Principles, countries can ensure they meet international commitments including the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) requirement 2.5 on BOT and the EU 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive.

Open Ownership sees the OO Principles as an important tool with a number of potential uses. So far, the OO Principles have been used to support implementing comprehensive beneficial ownership disclosure, through describing the key technical features of a disclosure regime that will generate actionable and usable data; and as evaluative tool, which can be used to assess the current state of play of BOT in a particular country (see the UK Assessment in Resources). Open Ownership is also interested in exploring other possible use cases.
