(https://register.openownership.org/)(GOOR) holds 12 million records with data from 200 jurisdictions. Because Open Ownership (OO) has been engaging with more countries and assisting them with publishing their beneficial ownership (BO) data, the amount of information in the register has been growing. More and new types of data means it is time to update the [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](http://standard.openownership.org/en/0.2.0/#) (BODS). The standard comes to life in the register by classifying and sorting the information so that users can find and analyse the data. 

Updating BODS is an ongoing process. It is informed primarily by the experience of OO’s technical and country teams as they engage with 40+ [countries](https://www.openownership.org/map/) on their beneficial ownership transparency (BOT) implementation journey. In 2021, the first country in the world, Latvia, is expected to publish their beneficial ownership (BO) data in BODS format. Armenia is close behind. Further afield, OO has received multiple requests from countries and partners on how to account for particular types of companies: for example, officials in [Ghana have sought advice on how to account for publicly listed companies](https://www.openownership.org/uploads/technical-note-beneficial-ownership-and-listed-companies.pdf) (PLCs). OO’s partners at the [Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative](https://eiti.org/role-of-stateowned-enterprises) (EITI) and the [Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org/what-is-open-contracting/beneficial-ownership/) (OCP) both operate in sectors where state-owned enterprise (SOE) transparency is critical for good governance. Both PLCs and SOEs are frontier issues for BOT, and in 2021 it is OO’s aim for these to be added to BODS and the GOOR. OO also aims to ensure that the GOOR and the BODS remain useful resources for the growing number of governments, companies, and people that routinely use them. 


## 1. Dealing with fresh and stale data 

Confidence in the quality of BO data relies in part on knowing whether it is fresh or stale. Data is fresh when it is new or recently confirmed as accurate - and it is stale when it hasn’t been updated. This is difficult because as BO registers mature they will accumulate more and more data, either as ownership changes or as companies resubmit their data. For users to navigate BO data with confidence, registers need the right tools to be explicit about what data is current, what data is stale, and when a historical statement of ownership begins and ends.

To make this task easier for publishers, OO will clarify and document how to record changes  using the BODS. New functionality will also be built to better reflect the legal and practical requirements to redact ownership data or mark it as stale. Deciding which data to archive and which can safely be removed is important for a well functioning register. Registers also need to remove secure or sensitive information from records, and provide an explanation for why that information is unavailable.
