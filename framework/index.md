Effective disclosure of beneficial ownership to deliver policy impact involves providing a public register of structured data drawing on robust definitions that provide for comprehensive coverage of all forms of ownership and control, collected with low thresholds for disclosure, and providing clear identifying information for people and entities that supports mapping of ownership chains.

The information should be accurate and published in a timely fashion, with historic records of ownership also made available. There should be enforcement mechanisms in place to guarantee compliance with disclosure requirements and ensure data quality.

Getting to effective disclosure and use of data benefits from a process of iterative development, and broad-based engagement.

## 1- A public register

The register is public

Having a public register means that law enforcement, businesses, journalists and citizens from around the world can access information on the beneficial ownership of companies.

## 2- Robust Definitions

There is a robust definition of beneficial ownership

Robust and clear definitions of beneficial ownership should cover all relevant forms of ownership and control, with any interests that are exempt from disclosure being limited, proportionate and clearly defined.

## 3- Comprehensive coverage

The coverage of the register is comprehensive

Having comprehensive coverage means *all relevant legal and natural persons and arrangements are included in the register, and any exemptions to disclosure are limited and proportionate.*

## 4- Low thresholds

Low thresholds are used to determine ownership and control

Having low thresholds means most, or all, people with beneficial ownership and control interests in a company are included in disclosures, and that the risk that someone with ownership or control remains hidden are reduced.

## 5- Ownership chains

Sufficient information to understand full ownership chains is collected

Covering full ownership chains means that it should be possible to understand the full ownership and control structure of a company. Disclosure of intermediate steps in an ownership chain helps with joining up data from different sources.

## 6- Clear identification

Clear identification exists for people and companies

Having clear identification for people and companies means that it is possible to match together disclosures about the same people or companies, and to tell apart different people with the same name, or similar details.

## 7- Accurate

Measures are taken to improve accuracy of the data

Having accurate information means that there are sufficient measures in place to increase confidence in disclosures as a high quality and reliable source of information, and to alert the appropriate authorities when there is a risk that they are not.

## 8- Timely and updated

Data is timely and updated

Having timely and updated disclosures means beneficial ownership information is updated within a short, defined time period after changes occur, and information is confirmed at least on an annual basis to keep registers up to date.

## 9- Historic records

Historic records are kept and made available

Providing historic records means when beneficial ownership or company structure information changes, this information is stored rather than replaced, and past disclosures remain publicly available for a reasonable period of time.

## 10- Enforcement

Adequate sanctions and enforcement exist for non compliance

Having enforcement processes means proportionate sanctions exist against non-compliance with disclosure requirements, including for non-submission, late submission, incomplete submission or faulty submission.

## 11- Engagement

Stakeholders are engaged throughout implementation

Engagement means delivering beneficial ownership transparency by involving a wide range of stakeholders from as many different groups as possible, from government officials to citizens and businesses, to create an effective disclosure regime that meets user needs, to help achieve their goals and improve impact.

## 12- Iterate & improve

The register is iterated on to deliver improvements and close loopholes

Iterate and improve means a long-term policy commitment to beneficial ownership transparency, and treating registers as an ongoing project, carried out step-by-step, with continual identification of ways to improve, close loopholes, and strengthen the use of information and data.
