Over 110 countries have committed to beneficial ownership transparency. More and more governments want to bring the real owners of companies into the open.

Open Ownership drives greater corporate transparency across the world by making it easy to publish and access-high quality, linked data about who owns companies.  Our multidisciplinary team works closely with technical and policy implementers, advising them on all aspects of BO implementation.  To support our donor-funded technical assistance programmes, we have developed a broad range of implementation tools and products, including the [beneficial ownership data standard](http://standard.openownership.org/en/latest/) and the [Open Ownership Principles](https://www.openownership.org/principles/).

We are a distributed team and are actively looking to diversify our geographical presence.
