Ten years ago, the idea of public registers of beneficial ownership was a campaigner’s long-shot. But now, with governments across the world committed to collecting and publishing information on the people who really own companies, [OpenOwnership](http://openownership.org) is making it a reality. 

With backing from multiple funding agencies, including the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID) and the World Bank, [OpenOwnership](http://openownership.org) is scaling its tools and support to increase beneficial ownership transparency globally, based on uptake of the [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](http://standard.openownership.org/en/v0-1/) and [OpenOwnership Register](https://register.openownership.org). At this critical stage, we are recruiting a number of new roles to scale our work. 

We are a distributed team, and are actively looking to diversify our geographical presence. We are a majority female team and strongly encourage other women and individuals from marginalized communities to apply.
