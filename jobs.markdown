Over 90 countries have committed to beneficial ownership transparency. More and more governments want to bring the real owners of companies into the open.

This helps to build market confidence, enable effective taxation, save money on schools and hospitals, and tackle corruption.

Open Ownership is a global hub for this kind of information and support, from drafting laws to verifying data and making it work in practice. Weâ€™re already starting to see the benefits, as well as the potential for much more impact.

We are a distributed team and are actively looking to diversify our geographical presence. We strongly encourage women and individuals from marginalized communities to apply.
