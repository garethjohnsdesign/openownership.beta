Over 90 countries have committed to beneficial ownership transparency. More and more governments want to bring the real owners of companies into the open.

This helps to build market confidence, enable effective taxation, save money on schools and hospitals, and tackle corruption.

Open Ownership is a global hub for this kind of information and support, from drafting laws to verifying data and making it work in practice. We’re already starting to see the benefits, as well as the potential for much more impact.

We are a distributed team and are actively looking to diversify our geographical presence. We strongly encourage women and individuals from marginalized communities to apply.

**About Open Ownership**
Open Ownership drives greater corporate transparency across the world by making it easy to publish and access-high quality, linked data about who owns companies.  Our multidisciplinary team works closely with technical and policy implementers, advising them on all aspects of BO implementation.  To support our donor-funded technical assistance programmes, we have developed a broad range of implementation tools and products, including the beneficial ownership data standard and the Open Ownership Principles.

**Purpose of the post**
We are about to start a new five year programme delivered in partnership with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), called Opening Extractives.  You’ll work with about 10 resource-rich countries, and this role will lead one of the six core workstreams of the programme. You will support people in the project countries to use beneficial ownership data to bring about social and economic benefits, and manage development of technical tools and solutions to do so. You will report to Open Ownership’s Director of Policy & Programmes, and have close working relationships with Open Ownership and the EITI, as well as external stakeholders in each of the participating countries.

**Key tasks and responsibilities**
1. Manage the development of technical tools to use beneficial ownership data.

Work with contractors and partners to initiate and develop data for impact projects and deliver iterative improvements to current tooling. Ensure that technical outcomes are delivered that meet the needs of users in the programme countries. (Our current tooling includes the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard, the Open Ownership Register and the BO Visualisation System).

Develop and implement our grant-giving technology innovation fund, together with colleagues, to enable country stakeholders to develop their own technical tools to use BO data to improve natural resource governance.

Contract-manage developers and our long-standing technical partner to develop technologies and tools to use BO data to deliver impact, in particular to improve natural resource governance.

Liaise with colleagues at OO and the EITI to track and document impact, progress and learning outcomes from the above initiatives, and apply learning throughout future work.

2. Manage technical support to assist country stakeholders in integrating beneficial ownership data within relevant technological systems and workflows.

Deliver technical assistance on technology and data use to governments and other stakeholders.

Act as a focal point to convene government publishers of beneficial ownership data, data users within and outside of government, and other stakeholders to advance implementation of systems and tools to use beneficial ownership data.

Analyse, or commission contractors to analyse, beneficial ownership data and software systems, and make recommendations to increase the utility and impact of these.

Support colleagues throughout the programme team by providing expertise on technical tools and approaches to use beneficial ownership data, for example by responding to queries and sharing learning through training sessions.

3. Lead engagement with national and international community of civic tech, govtech and private sector data users to identify use cases for BO data and build stakeholder capacity.

Design and deliver discovery workshops and consultation sessions to identify user needs in participating countries and document high priority use cases for beneficial ownership data.

Work with colleagues to develop materials and deliver training on using beneficial ownership data tailored to national context and stakeholder priorities. The training will be for government officials, civil society and private sector actors,  and focused on data use to improve natural resource governance. 

Work with colleagues to use this information to guide development of impactful further interventions.

The successful candidate will demonstrate the following skills and attributes:

At least 6 years experience of working in data-oriented roles which are public-facing and/or with diverse stakeholders.

Fluent business English with excellent communication skills, both written and verbal (other languages in addition are welcomed, in particular Spanish or French).
