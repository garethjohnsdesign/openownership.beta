description: Implementing beneficial ownership transparency is likely to require changes
  to legislation and regulation. This section outlines the aspects relevant to putting
  in place an effective legal framework for beneficial ownership transparency, and
  provides resources to help.
tip-text: 'When designing law and regulation, it is important to understand how people
  need to use beneficial ownership data in order to achieve your policy impact. The
  legal framework should then be designed to meet these needs. '

- title: What legislation and regulation is required for beneficial ownership transparency
  text: "Whilst the policy making process varies between countries, there are a number
    of aspects that need to be considered when designing a legal framework for beneficial
    ownership transparency. These are: \n\n##### The scope of the policy\n- The types
    of legal entity and natural persons covered.\n- Whether information about Politically
    Exposed Persons is to be collected.\n\n##### The definition of beneficial ownership\n-
    How beneficial ownership is defined in law, for example through shareholdings,
    voting rights and rights to appoint/remove directors.\n- The granularity of beneficial
    ownership interests that need to be declared, and whether thresholds or banding
    are to be used.\n- Where beneficial ownership is exerted indirectly, the extent
    to which ownership chains are described.\n\n##### Requirements for companies to
    submit and update beneficial ownership information.\n- If a new policy is being
    implemented, when companies will be required to submit beneficial ownership information.\n-
    What conditions will require companies to update their beneficial ownership information.\n\n#####
    Whether the use of identifiers for legal and natural persons needs to be specified
    in law or regulation\n\n##### What steps will be taken to verify the information
    that is submitted, and analyse submissions to identify suspicious entries for
    investigation.\n\n##### What sanctions will be put in place for non-compliance
    against the beneficial owner and/or legal entity for failing to declare, or declaring
    false information.\n\nOur Policy Reviewer tool works through each of these areas
    in turn, and helps implementers to identify specific decision points around what
    data is to be collected and what is to be published, and helps identify the legal
    changes necessary to achieve this. The Policy Reviewer does not prescribe a particular
    policy approach, but is designed to help implementers to explore the relevant
    areas. For OpenOwnership’s recommendations of good practice, please see our briefing
    on Characteristics of Effective Beneficial Ownership Data, and other content throughout
    this guide.\n\nOpenOwnership’s experience suggests that as with many policy areas,
    once an initial beneficial ownership transparency policy is in place, further
    changes to legislation or regulation may be needed to refine it and improve effectiveness
    over time.\n"
