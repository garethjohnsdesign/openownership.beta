Optional Features allow BOVS diagrams to be progressively enhanced. If you choose to use an Optional Feature, you must follow all of its related rules.

**We recommend that you always incorporate Annotation and Colour** features unless it's cumbersome to do so, e.g. when hand-sketching.


## [Annotation](/visualisation/optional/annotation)

Specify the nature or level of interest for each line in the diagram.


## [Colour](/visualisation/optional/colour)

Use colour to make ownership and control information easier to understand at a glance.


## [Line Weight](/visualisation/optional/weight)

Draw stronger interests with heavier arrows.


## [Charts](/visualisation/optional/charts)

Summarise ownership or control information with a bar chart incorporated into the diagram.


## [Metadata](/visualisation/optional/metadata)

Give additional information about the Parties in your diagram with icons.
