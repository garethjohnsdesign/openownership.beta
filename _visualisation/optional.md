**The Optional Features of the Beneficial Ownership Visualisation System (BODS) allow diagrams to be progressively enhanced.** If you choose to use an Optional Feature, you must follow all of its related rules.

**We recommend that you always incorporate Annotation and Colour** features unless it's cumbersome to do so, e.g. when hand-sketching.

[Annotation](/visualisation/optional/)
: Specify the nature or level of interest for each line in the diagram

[Colour](/visualisation/optional/)
: Use colour to make ownership and control information easier to understand at a glance

[Charts](/visualisation/optional/)
: Summarise ownership or control information with a bar chart incorporated into the diagram

[Metadata](/visualisation/optional/)
: Give additional information about the Parties in your diagram with icons
