You can use [our register](https://register.openownership.org) to get some
example data if you don't have any to hand.

This tool is a work in progress, but you can find the underlying code on
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openownership/bods-dagre) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/openownership/visualisation-tool) if you want to
reuse it. Our GitHub repo has instructions for using it in different
applications.
