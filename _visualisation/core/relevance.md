**Diagrams must be complete: no Party may be omitted.** This ensures diagrams never mislead by suggesting that structures are simpler than they truly are.

Which Parties must be included for a diagram to be 'complete' is determined by your diagram's [Focus and Distance](/visualisation/core/focus-distance).

**However, you may consider only some Parties or interest Chains to be *relevant*** to your point. If so, there are ways to collapse or diminish the other parts of your diagram while maintaining an accurate portrayal of the situation:

* [Stacks](/visualisation/core/stacks) let you reduce a Chain of interests, or multiple Subjects, into a single Node.
* You may draw non-relevant parts of your diagram less prominently, e.g. slightly greyed-out.
* [Optional Features](/visualisation/optional) may be applied only to the Chains you consider to be relevant.

If you apply Optional Features only to relevant parts, then you *must* also draw non-relevant parts less prominently. This ensures readers understand why those Optional Features are not shown elsewhere.
