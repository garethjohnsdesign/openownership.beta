## Direction

* The direction of the Arrow is the direction of the interest, phrased in an active voice, i.e. the Party at the start of the Arrow is interested in the Party at the end of the Arrow.
* All Arrows in a diagram must proceed in the same direction.
  * e.g. always down, or always left/right, according to your chosen [Directionality](/visualisation/core/directionality).
  * This must be kept consistent unless it is logically impossible to do so, for instance in cases of circular relationships.
  

## Nature and Strength

There are two types of interest relationship: **ownership** and **control**.

* The **nature** of an interest is whether it is an ownership or control interest.
* The **strength** of an interest is how much interest exists, for instance 10% ownership vs. 90% ownership.

Just one Arrow is used to represent any nature or strength of interest.

* Under the [Core Rules](/visualisation/core), the design of the Arrow provides no indication of the nature or strength of interest.
* Using the [Optional Features](/visualisation/optional) for [Annotation](/visualisation/optional/annotation) and [Colour](/visualisation/optional/colour), you can indicate the specific nature and/or strength of interest that an Arrow represents.


## Appearance

* Draw Arrows as clearly as possible.
* Arrows may be drawn straight, curly or with elbow joints – whatever works best.
* Don't omit the arrowhead – this ensures the direction of interest flow is clear.
