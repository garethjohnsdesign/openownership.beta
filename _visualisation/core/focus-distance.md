## Focus

**Diagrams have either a Subject or Object focus.** That is, they either:

* Focus on selected Objects, then trace backwards all of their Beneficiaries.
* Focus on selected Subjects, and trace forwards all the Objects they are interested in.

### Object Focus

![Example of a Backwards BOVS Diagram]()

Diagrams with an Object Focus (the most common) show all the Parties that exist in the reverse direction of the Arrows from the selected Objects (usually just one). For instance, it may trace all of the Parties interested in a specific Company, back to a set of Persons.

### Subject Focus

![Example of a Forwards BOVS Diagram]()

Diagrams with a Subject Focus show all the Parties that exist in the forward direction of the Arrows from the selected Subjects (usually just one). For instance, it may show all the interests of a specific Person.

## Distance

**Diagrams have a Distance, which, unless you decide and note otherwise, is unlimited.** All Chains in the diagram are cut short at a length equal to the Distance.

In backwards diagrams, this allows you to focus on:

* The ultimate Beneficiaries of the Entity you are focusing on (unlimited Distance)
* The Parties interested in the Entity through a given number of intermediaries (Distance X)
* The immediate Beneficiaries of the Entity only (Distance 1)

In forwards diagrams, this allows you to show either:

* All the Entities that the Subjects you are focusing on have an interest in, through any number of intermediaries (unlimited Distance)
* All the Entities that the Subjects have an interest in, through a given number of intermediaries (Distance X)
* The Direct interests of the Subjects only (Distance 1)

If you choose to use a Distance that is not unlimited:

* You must state the Distance you have chosen clearly in the information provided with your diagram.
* Any Chains that are cut short due to your choice must indicate this with an Arrow that trails off (see image).
