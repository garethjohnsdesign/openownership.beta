## General website information

If you use our websites, we will make a record of the information your web browser sends to us, typically identifying the type of browser you are using, and your IP address. We record this information in full where necessary, for example to detect bugs and prevent hostile access. Where we can, we only record an anonymized version of your IP address, for example to understand the ways in which people use our website and where in the world they are. We keep our web server logs, where the full information is stored, for up to one year.

We share this information with the following service providers:

* Netlify, ReadTheDocs, Github and Heroku (web hosting)
* Papertrail (log storage)
* Google Analytics (anonymised visitor statistics)

who are all under an obligation not to use your information for any other purpose.

## Cookies

To make our websites work properly, we sometimes place small data files called “cookies” on your device. Most big websites do this too. We only use cookies when they are strictly necessary for the functionality of our sites.

### What are cookies?

A cookie is a small text file that a website (including this website) saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.

### How do we use cookies?

The following table explains the cookies we use and why we use them.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Cookie/Technology</th>
    <th>Name(s)</th>
    <th>Purpose</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>

  </tr>
</table>

### How to control cookies

You can control and/or delete cookies and other storage technologies as you wish – for details, see [aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/). You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.

## Emails

If you sign up to be on our mailing list via this website, we will ask you for the following information:

* First name
* Last name
* Email address

Unless we are in direct correspondence with you – for example because you have asked us specific questions about our products or services – we will only use this information to send you newsletters. We will also record your details in our CRM system.

You may unsubscribe from our mailing lists at any time and any promotional email we send you will contain an option to enable you to unsubscribe. Our mailing list provider will retain your details as an unsubscribed contact, so that we cannot accidentally re-add you to a list manually.

We will not allow any third parties to make use of your email information, but we may use third party data processors, for example to automate our handling of mailing lists. Any use we make of data processors will require them only to act only on our instructions concerning your personal data. We currently use the following data processors:

* Mailchimp (mailing list management)
* Hubspot (customer record management)
* Google GSuite (email and office software)
* GitHub (backup processing)
* Kaseya (backup storage)

## Contributors to the register

If you have signed up to incorporate data about your company into the Open Ownership Register, we will also process:

* Your name
* Your company name and position
* A company email address and an associated password
* The IP address from which you are currently signed in and from which you last signed in

We use this information in order to verify your identity whenever you login, to protect your identity from malicious access and we may use it to help us verify the accuracy of any information you submit for inclusion in the register. We may also contact you through the email address you provide to assist us with this verification process.

We will retain this information for as long as you maintain an account on the register. If you delete your account, we will remove all records of the data listed above and those of any submissions (including drafts) you have made under that account. However, we will only remove beneficial ownership data which has already been included in the register through your submissions in accordance with [our policy for data retention on the Open Ownership Register](https://register.openownership.org/terms-and-conditions).

We use the email processing service Postmark to send you emails related to your account, for example to reset your password.

## Data included in the register

We have [a separate page](https://register.openownership.org/privacy) which covers the personal information we may include in our Open Ownership Register, our legal basis for collecting it and your rights. That page supplements this one.

## Contact and error reporting forms

If you use any of our online forms to report errors with our data, request that we correct or remove your information, or to contact us for general support, we will process:

* Your name
* Your email address
* Any information you give us to confirm your identity

We use this information to respond to you and to identify data which relates to you so that you may exercise your rights to it, as set out in [our privacy policy for the Open Ownership Register](https://register.openownership.org/privacy).

We may use third party data processors, for example to process form submissions and triage incoming support email. Any use we make of data processors will require them only to act only on our instructions concerning your personal data. We currently use the following data processors:

* Hubspot (form creation and support triage)

We will retain this information indefinitely.

## Webinars and other online events

If you register to attend a webinar or other online event we will process:

* Your name
* Your country/region
* Your company/organisation name
* Your job title
* Your email address

We use this information to give you access to the webinar event and to understand who is attending our events.

If you attend an online event, we will also process information about the times you start and stop attending the event. We use this information to understand how popular our events are and how our audience engages with them.

We may use third party data processors, for example to manage event registrations and access control. Any use we make of data processors will require them only to act only on our instructions concerning your personal data. We currently use the following data processors:

* Zoom (event hosting, registration and access control)

We will retain this information indefinitely.

## Lawful basis

It is lawful for us, under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to process the information described in this notice because

* We have a legitimate interest in operating our websites and using the information we collect for these purposes.
* Where you have signed up to a mailing list, we have a legitimate interest in emailing you so long as you do not object to our doing so.
* Where you have contacted us through a form, we have a legitimate interest in responding to or acting upon your contact.
* Where you have signed up to be a contributor, you give consent to us using the information you supplied to us, in order to control access to the information you supply and hence to improve the quality of the register.
* Where you have registered to attend an event, we obtain your consent to use your information to provide access to it and record your attendance when you sign up.

We do not believe the way in which we are processing them is likely to cause you any harm.

## Transfer of data outside Europe

* Web server application logs are sent to Papertrail in the US
* Mailing list sign up information is sent to Mailchimp and Hubspot in the US
* Backups of Hubspot are processed by Github and Spanning in the US
* Requests sent through our contact forms or error reporting forms are sent to Hubspot in the US
* Registrations for webinars or other online events are sent to Zoom in the US
* Data collected during attendance of webinars or other online events is sent to Zoom in the US

## Your rights

Under the [General Data Protection Regulation](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN) you have a number of important rights free of charge. In summary, those include rights to:

* otherwise restrict our processing of your personal information in certain circumstances

For further information on each of those rights, including the circumstances in which they apply, see the [Guidance from the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) on individuals rights under the General Data Protection Regulation](http://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/).

If you would like to exercise any of those rights, please:

If you would like to unsubscribe from any email newsletter you can also click on the ‘unsubscribe’ button at the bottom of the email.  Unsubscribing is automatic and effective immediately, but email may already be in transit when you unsubscribe.

The [General Data Protection Regulation](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN) also gives you the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the European Union (or European Economic Area) state where you work, normally live or where any alleged infringement of data protection laws occurred.

## Who we are

We are Open Ownership, a fiscally sponsored project of Global Impact, 1199 N. Fairfax St., Suite 300, Alexandria, VA, 22314, US. . Although we are based outside Europe, we have appointed our Technical Lead, [info@openownership.org](mailto:info@openownership.org) as our representative in Europe for data protection purposes.
