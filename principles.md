title: Principles for Effective Beneficial Ownership Disclosure
layout: principles-index
---

The Open Ownership Principles set the gold standard for effective beneficial ownership disclosure. The OO Principles are intended to support governments implementing beneficial ownership reforms, and guide international institutions, civil society and private sector actors in understanding and advocating for effective reforms.

There are nine principles in total - together they provide a framework for implementing comprehensive transparent company ownership that generates actionable and usable data. Effective disclosure needs high quality, reliable data to maximise usability and minimise loopholes.

The OO Principles are based on Open Ownershipâ€™s work with almost 40 countries and on established good practices for open data and findings from practitioner and academic research. The OO Principles focus on the technical characteristics of effective disclosure regimes, rather than on the external political, social, economic and cultural factors that are known to influence implementation and impact.

As the policy area of beneficial ownership transparency continues to evolve, Open Ownership will continue to refine and update the OO Principles to ensure they remain a high but achievable standard that delivers impact.

The OO Principles are currently open for consultation with stakeholders. We will publish a set of framing questions for the consultation in January 2021, and welcome responses both in writing or by attending our roundtable discussion.
