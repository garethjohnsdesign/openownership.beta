<h3>About OpenOwnership</h3>
<p>OpenOwnership is the initiative of a group of leading organizations advocating for greater financial transparency and an end to anonymous company ownership and control structures. We do this by providing technology and technical assistance that supports both publishers and users of beneficial ownership data. Through our partners and independently, we aim to lead the creation of an open data and policy ecosystem that ends the abuse of anonymously owned companies by money launderers, corrupt politicians and businesses, and tax evaders.</p>
<p>In April 2017 we launched the OpenOwnership register, the first global public beneficial ownership register in the world. The OpenOwnership register and data standard should enable businesses to know who they are doing business with, financial institutions to know who their customers are, citizens to see who wins public contracts, and law enforcement to hold individuals accountable for crime and corruption. We are developing an associated data standard and have committed partnerships from governments and companies to the next phase.</p>
<h3>The next phase</h3>
<p>The project has completed its first phase; we have a minimal viable product, private sector, public sector and civil society stakeholder working groups, growing visibility of the tool’s potential via strategic communications and external relationships, commitments from two governments to partner on data exchange and a strategy for the coming years to generate impact.</p>
<p>Phase 2 will scale up the project to implementation and impact phase and so, will require the development of internal policies and procedures that can professionalise the project to realise its potential and ensure its sustainability. For that to happen we need to establish an effective and efficient governance structure and policies and procedures that ensures we capitalise on opportunities and current funding realities.</p>
<h3>Current set-up</h3>
<p>The register has been established by a coalition of international organizations, including Global Witness, Open Contracting Partnership, OpenCorporates, The B Team, The Web Foundation, Transparency International and ONE. These organisations compose the Steering Group, co-chaired by the representatives from two organisations. The Steering group hired a coordinator to facilitate the Steering Group organizations’ partnership and delivery of the project plan for the first year.</p>
<p>The OO staff base will now grow from a single coordinator to a small team charged with delivery of the strategy and managed by a Project Lead. Overall governance, ownership and responsibility for the project remains with the Steering Group and they sign off on the strategy and approve any major organisational developments.</p>
<p>In September, Fund for the City of New York became the fiscal sponsor of OpenOwnership. OO staff are employed by that partner and are responsible for delivery of activities and financial management of the project. FCNY provides light-touch technical oversight of funds and legal governance, but the Steering Group remains responsible, for the direction, the strategy, and as the ultimate ‘owners’ of the project. We are now seeking to formalise and adopt an efficient and effective governance structure to enable strategic long-term governance of the project and ensure the buy-in and input of OpenOwnership stakeholders.</p>
<h3>Terms of Reference</h3>
<p>Collect and analyse input from key stakeholders about the governance needs of OpenOwnership.
Based on consultation, research, and experience propose options with recommendations for overall governance structure, oversight and authority including  recommendations for Steering Group membership, composition, roles and working methods (including decision-making, sign off of key policies and strategies and transparency).
Present options to the Steering Committee for discussion.
Develop final outline of the option chosen.
Support processes to share final decisions with OpenOwnership stakeholders including potentially hosting workshop to share conclusions (online or in person) if relevant.</p>
