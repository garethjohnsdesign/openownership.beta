title: Beneficial Ownership Visualisation System
layout: visualisation
---

**The Beneficial Ownership Visualisation System (BOVS) is a set of visualisation rules** for producing diagrams that represent beneficial ownership structures as clearly as possible.

We encourage anyone who needs to visualise beneficial ownership situations to follow these visualisation rules. The rules are compatible with any brand, style or colour scheme, and are provided under the Apache Licence 2.0.

Diagrams that follow the BOVS are called **BOVS Diagrams**.


## Benefits

**BOVS ensures your diagrams are easy to understand**, because:

* All of your diagrams will follow a consistent logical approach.
* Your diagrams will be consistent with those published by OpenOwnership and many other organisations.
* You will benefit from the [design principles]() we followed when creating the System, in particular to avoid accidental ambiguities.

**BOVS can save you time**, because:

* Beneficial ownership structures can be more complex than they appear, especially as they often contain unknowns. Visualising these clearly can be surprisingly challenging.
* The System is designed to be applicable to any situation that can be described by the [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard]() (BODS). We also offer a [tool to automatically create BOVS Diagrams]() from BODS data.


## Example

![Example of a BOVS diagram](bovs-index-example.jpg)

The above shows an example of a BOVS diagram. This describes a situation where:

* We are interested in who ultimately owns and controls Widgets, Inc.
* There is a Company that owns 50% of Widgets, Inc., and controls 25% of it (e.g. has 25% of the voting rights). Its name has not been declared, so we label it Anonymous Company B.
	* Amy owns 100% of Anonymous Company B, and therefore owns 50% of Widgets, Inc.
	* Another Person controls 100% of Anonymous Company B, and therefore controls 25% of Widgets, Inc. The name of this other Person has not been declared, so we label them Anonymous Person A.
* Bob has an interest in Widgets, Inc. via an unknown chain of interests in at least 2 intermediary Entities.
  * Though we lack knowledge about the unknown chain, we know the ultimate result is that Bob owns 50% of Widgets, Inc., and has 75% control of it.


## How to draw BOVS Diagrams

### [Core Rules](/visualisation/core)

The Core Rules must be used for all BOVS Diagrams.

[Learn the Core Rules](/visualisation/core)

### [Optional Features](/visualisation/optional/)

You may choose to enhance your diagrams further with the following Optional Features. If doing so, you must follow all the rules for that Optional Feature. **We recommend that you always incorporate Annotation and Colour** features unless it's cumbersome to do so, e.g. when hand-sketching.

[Annotation](/visualisation/optional/)
: Specify the nature or level of interest for each line in the diagram

[Colour](/visualisation/optional/)
: Use colour to make ownership and control information easier to understand at a glance

[Charts](/visualisation/optional/)
: Summarise ownership or control information with a bar chart incorporated into the diagram

[Metadata](/visualisation/optional/)
: Give additional information about the Parties in your diagram with icons
