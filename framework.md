layout: framework-index
---

The following 12 principles for effective beneficial ownership disclosure outline key considerations to make data easier to use, more accurate, and more interoperable. These draft principles are the product of OpenOwnershipâ€™s work developing the [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](https://standard.openownership.org) and working with almost 40 countries to advance beneficial ownership transparency. These principles are informed by established practices for publishing open data, a review of available research and evidence, and our ongoing learning. 

Under each of the 12 principles, we have also drafted a set of indicators and narrative assessment questions, built on those used within our technical assistance. We will share these with partners for input and discussion over the coming weeks.
