title: Effective Disclosure Framework
layout: framework-index
---

*Effective disclosure of beneficial ownership involves providing **a public register** of structured data drawing on **robust definitions** that provide for **comprehensive coverage** of all forms of ownership and control, collected with **low thresholds** for disclosure, and providing **clear identifying information** for people and entities that supports mapping of **ownership chains**.* 

*The information should be **accurate** and published in a **timely** fashion, with **historic records** of ownership also made available. There should be **enforcement** mechanisms in place to guarantee data quality.* 

*Getting to effective disclosure and use of data benefits from a process of **iterative development**, and broad-based **engagement**.*


## About the Effective Disclosure Framework

This framework brings together OpenOwnership's learning on what makes for effective beneficial ownership disclosure. By this, we mean disclosure that can meet a wide range of policy objectives, which avoids creating loopholes, and which generates data that can become part of the global shift towards transparency over who owns and controls companies.

We use this framework to:

* **Inform our policy review work** - looking at how a disclosure regime addresses each key component of the framework.
* **Guide the creation of data systems** 
* **Evaluate published data** 
* **Structure our guidance, resources and support** - breaking down complex beneficial ownership reforms into bite-size chunks
 
This is an *alpha release* of the framework, which remains a work in progress.
