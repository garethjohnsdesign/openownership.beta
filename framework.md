title: Principles for Effective Beneficial Ownership Disclosure
layout: framework-index
---

The following outlines 12 principles for effective beneficial ownership disclosure designed to  make published data more easy to use, accurate, and interoperable. These have been reached through OpenOwnership’s work developing the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard and supporting almost 40 countries to advance beneficial ownership transparency. The principles are informed by established approaches for publishing open data and review of available research and evidence. 

For OpenOwnership, effective disclosure means high quality, reliable data to maximise usability, and minimise loopholes. The 12 principles are core tenets of effective disclosure, and describe a range of policy, legal, and systems, data and technology characteristics that effective disclosure regimes have. Disclosure regimes sit within a wider political economy context, which is considered throughout OpenOwnership’s assistance to governments in implementing beneficial ownership transparency. For more information, please see [OpenOwnership’s Implementation Guide](/guide/).

Under each of the 12 principles, we have drafted a set of indicators and narrative assessment questions, built on those used within our technical assistance. We will share these with partners for input and discussion over the coming weeks.
