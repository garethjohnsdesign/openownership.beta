  To mark International Anti-Corruption Day (December 9th), we are taking action with our partners to call time on the use of anonymous company ownership facilitating corruption and societal harms like trafficking and modern slavery.

  In collaboration with Open Government Partnership, the UK Government and World Bank, we are launching a day of action including two events to advance the shift towards beneficial ownership transparency around the world.

why-title: Why beneficial ownership matters
why-text: |-
  Open Ownership is increasing beneficial ownership transparency across the world by making it easier to access high-quality and connected data about who owns, controls and benefits from companies.

  Realising the benefits of corporate ownership transparency helps tackle corruption, reduce investment risk and improve global governance.

  Beneficial ownership data answers the fundamental question in any anti-corruption investigation: who benefits.

  In an age when trust, transparency and purpose are key drivers, ending anonymous company ownership worldwide will stop illicit activity causing economic and societal harms.
priorities-title: Our priorities
priorities-text: |-
  We are focused on three closely connected strategic priorities:

  1. Building the worldâ€™s first global, open beneficial ownership register and data standard. The OpenOwnership Register is an easy-to-use, cloud-based, platform that aggregates beneficial ownership information from multiple sources and makes it available for free to all, allowing for powerful global searches with just a couple of clicks. Information from more than 4.5 million companies is already available through the online portal. The Beneficial Ownership Data Standard is a conceptual and practical framework for collecting and publishing beneficial ownership data, making it a powerful cost-saving tool for implementers of beneficial ownership transparency.

  2. Supporting the implementation of beneficial ownership transparency. We are helping governments to implement beneficial ownership regimes, working across the spectrum of technical, administrative, and policy/regulatory issues that affect the ultimate usability of published data.

  3. Developing and sharing beneficial ownership best practice. Driving awareness of the benefits of high-quality beneficial ownership data, and growing demand for it, are vital to our mission. This means sharing research, case studies and best practice through our networks, at events and conferences, and with influencers in the public and private sectors.
