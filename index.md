  This is why since 2016, over 80 countries have made plans to create public registers of company owners, or committed to disclosing ownership data.

  These reforms hold huge promise - but they will only be as good as their implementation. Data needs to be consistently high-quality, easy to search and cross-reference globally. Technical expertise and tools are required to design systems that work for specific national contexts, drawing on experience and lessons from elsewhere.

  This is where OpenOwnership comes in. We are a global hub for this kind of information and support, from drafting laws to verifying data and making it work in practice.

  We’re already starting to see the benefits. Over US$ 1 billion has been recovered by governments using beneficial ownership data. With our support, countries like Armenia, Ukraine and Nigeria are using public registers to expose and tackle corruption. It’s just the beginning.
