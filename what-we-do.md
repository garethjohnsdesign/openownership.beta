  icon: one-on-one
  text: The Register is an easy-to-use, cloud-based, platform that links beneficial
    ownership information from multiple sources and makes it available for free to
    all, allowing for powerful global searches with just a couple of clicks. Data
    on the platform comes from regulatory sources such as national companies registers
    and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. It is also self-submitted
    by companies through our sleek, intuitive reporting interface. Information from
    more than 5 million companies is already available through the online portal.

- title: Building a stable and trusted beneficial ownership data standard and user
    base
  icon: building
  text: The Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (the Standard, or BODS) is being developed
    in collaboration with dozens of international experts in company data and in technical
    standard-setting. It will enable the resulting beneficial ownership data to be
    interoperable, more easily reused, and higher quality. We are engaging with public
    and private sector publishers of beneficial ownership data to encourage uptake
    of the Standard.

    Partnership, the group is comprised of Armenia, Kenya, Latvia, Mexico and the
