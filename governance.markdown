Open Ownership is a non-profit run by a small, expert team well positioned to
support countries implementing beneficial ownership transparency (BOT). Our
day-to-day management relies on an executive team who are overseen by a
Steering Group made up of leading transparency and accountability organisations.

In order to focus on our mission, Open Ownership is fiscally sponsored by
Global Impact. Fiscal sponsorship is a common mechanism in the non-profit sector
that enables organisations to launch new programmes without needing to complete
the full process of establishing a new legal entity.

The Steering Group and our partners help ensure that our organisation is
strategic and focused on our mission. The Steering Group also contributes to
fundraising and publicly champions BOT.
