Beneficial ownership transparency should be implemented with user needs in mind in order to maximise impact. Therefore, delivering improved beneficial ownership transparency is a process that should involve as many different groups as possible, from government officials to citizens and businesses. 

Stakeholder engagement and consultation throughout the implementation process are a central part of any beneficial ownership transparency journey. Without this work, the system of collection and publication that is delivered may not be well known or well suited to the groups and people impacted, could be hard to use and may not meet usersâ€™ needs.
