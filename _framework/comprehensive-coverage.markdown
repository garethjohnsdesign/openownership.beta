Having comprehensive coverage means all relevant legal entities and arrangements, and all natural persons must be included in disclosures.

Comprehensive coverage is important because legal entities and arrangements not covered form potential loopholes that can be exploited for illegitimate purposes. This was the case, for instance, with Scottish Limited Partnerships in the UK, until they were included in the disclosure regime (see resources). 

Any exemptions that mean certain classes of person or entity are not to be included in the public register should be limited and proportionate.
