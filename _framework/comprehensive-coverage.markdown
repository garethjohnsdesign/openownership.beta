title: Disclosure should comprehensively cover all relevant types of legal entities
  and natural persons
component: Comprehensive coverage
order: 2
summary_version: |-
  1. All relevant legal entities and arrangements, and all relevant natural persons (i.e. people), should be included in disclosures.
  2. Any exemptions of certain types of entity from the disclosure requirements (such as for listed companies) should be clearly defined and justified, and information on the ownership of such entities should be collected elsewhere with comparable levels of quality and access.
  3. Particular attention should be given to the disclosure requirements relating to ownership by state owned enterprises (SOEs).

Comprehensive coverage is important because if certain types of legal entities and arrangements are not covered, potential loopholes form that can be exploited for illegitimate purposes. Understanding where and how SOEs are involved in ownership or control of reporting companies can be an important element of understanding corruption risk. Due to their connections to PEPs, involvement of SOEs in an ownership chain can be an important piece of information to consider within due diligence and investigations.
