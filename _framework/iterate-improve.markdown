title: Disclosure processes and practices should be iterated on to deliver improvements
  and close loopholes
---

Beneficial ownership transparency is an emerging policy field, and best practice is still developing and being identified. Best practice will also differ from place to place, and will depend on specific contexts. 

As beneficial ownership transparency is implemented, new loopholes may emerge. It is therefore critical that disclosure regimes iterate and improve. This means treating beneficial ownership reform as a long-term policy commitment, and resourcing registers as an ongoing project, carried out step-by-step, with continual identification of ways to improve, close loopholes, and strengthen the use of information and data.
