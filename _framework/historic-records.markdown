Providing historic records means that when beneficial ownership or company structure information changes, this information is stored rather than replaced, and past disclosures remain publicly available. It is important to keep historical information about companies, as this can help uncover links that are not immediately evident from current information. For example, keeping historical records would prevent an entity from obscuring its identity by changing its name.
