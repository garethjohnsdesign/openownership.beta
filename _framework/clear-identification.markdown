  Having clear identification for people and companies, whilst respecting relevant privacy laws, means that it is possible to match together disclosures about the same people or companies, and to tell apart different people with the same name, or similar details.

Having clear identification for people and companies, whilst respecting relevant privacy laws, means that it is possible to match together disclosures about the same people or companies, and to tell apart different people with the same name, or similar details. 

Users of the data should be provided with enough information to allow them to do this, and match the information with other datasets. Being able to disambiguate is important, for instance when entities emulate the names of respectable companies in order to obfuscate ownership in due diligence processes. 

Particular attention should also be given to identifying politically exposed persons, as they hold positions that can be abused for the purposes of laundering illicit funds, corruption or bribery, and therefore have higher risks associated with them.
