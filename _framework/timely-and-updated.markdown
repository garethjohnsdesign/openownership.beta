Having timely and up to date disclosures means beneficial ownership information is updated within a short, defined time period after changes occur, and information is confirmed at least on an annual basis to keep registers up to date. 

Being up to date increases data quality by improving accuracy, as well as reliability. Reliable data will allow data users to use the data with confidence. For instance, showing when company statements were made allows users to judge whether they trust the information.
