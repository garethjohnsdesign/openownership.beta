Covering full ownership chains means that it should be possible to understand how beneficial owners exert ownership or control over a company, even when beneficial ownership is held indirectly through one or more other companies. This greatly increases the usability of the data, thereby increasing the potential impact a register can have. 

Disclosure of intermediate steps in an ownership chain also helps with joining up data from different sources. The ability to link beneficial ownership information from around the world is essential to realising the full potential of beneficial ownership data to expose transnational networks of illicit financial flows and support robust and efficient due diligence.
