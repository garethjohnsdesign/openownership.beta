Having a centralised public register means that law enforcement, businesses, journalists and citizens from around the world can easily access information on the beneficial ownership of companies, subject to relevant privacy laws.

The utility of a public register is enhanced when the data is available online, in a structured format, and without use of barriers such as registration or payment.
