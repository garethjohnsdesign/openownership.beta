Having a centralised public beneficial ownership register means that law enforcement, businesses, journalists and citizens from around the world can easily access information on the beneficial ownership of companies, subject to relevant privacy laws. Having widespread third party use on data can drive up data quality, and increasing the user base beyond authorities will increase impact. For instance, publicly available beneficial ownership data can reduce the cost and complexity of due diligence and risk management for the private sector, thereby leveling the playing field and increasing competitiveness.

The utility of a public register is enhanced when the data is available online, in a structured format, and without use of barriers such as registration or payment. This also allows registers to be linked with other datasets, which helps realise the utility of beneficial ownership data to expose transnational networks of illicit financial flows and support effective and timely due diligence.
