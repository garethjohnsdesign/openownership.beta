Having low thresholds means most, or all, people with beneficial ownership and control interests in a company are included in disclosures, and that the risk that someone with relevant ownership or control remains hidden are reduced.

Particular consideration should be given to the thresholds that apply to politically exposed persons with ownership or control interests.
