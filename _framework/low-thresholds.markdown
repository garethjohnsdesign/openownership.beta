title: Low thresholds should be used to determine when beneficial ownership and control
  must be disclosed
---

Having low thresholds means most, or all, people with beneficial ownership and control interests in a company are included in disclosures, and that the risk that someone with relevant ownership or control remains hidden are reduced.

While extremely low thresholds may not be practical, or may become too labour and cost intensive without providing useful insight into significant ownership or control, using thresholds that are too high can form a potential loophole that can be exploited. Therefore, disclosure regimes should use a risk-based approach to setting thresholds. To aid interpretation and linking of the data to create ownership graphs, absolute values, rather than ranges, should be used when disclosing the percentage of ownership or control that a beneficial owner has. 

Particular consideration should be given to the thresholds that apply to politically exposed persons with ownership or control interests.
