Having low thresholds means most, or all, people with beneficial ownership and control interests in a company are included in disclosures, and that the risk that someone with relevant ownership or control remains hidden are reduced. Absolute values, rather than ranges, should be used when disclosing the percentage of ownership or control that a beneficial owner has.

Particular consideration should be given to the thresholds that apply to politically exposed persons with ownership or control interests.
