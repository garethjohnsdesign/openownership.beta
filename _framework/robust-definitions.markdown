Robust and clear definitions of beneficial ownership should cover all relevant forms of ownership and control. Failure to do so can leave the forms of ownership and control not covered in a disclosure regime vulnerable for exploitation by those seeking to abuse the system. 

Any exemptions that mean certain interests are excluded from disclosure should be limited, proportionate and clearly defined.
