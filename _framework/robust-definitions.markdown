title: Beneficial Ownership should be clearly and robustly defined in law, with low thresholds used to determine when ownership and control is disclosed
component: Robust definitions
order: 1
summary_version: |-
  1. Robust and clear definitions of beneficial ownership should cover all relevant forms of ownership and control.
  2. Low thresholds for triggering BO disclosure should be used so that most, or all, people with beneficial ownership and control interests are included in disclosures.
  3. Particular consideration should be given to thresholds that apply to ownership by politically exposed persons (PEPs), with a clear definition used to determine what constitutes a PEP.
  4. Absolute values, rather than ranges, should be used when reporting the percentage of ownership or control that a beneficial owner has.

Clearly defining beneficial ownership and ensuring it covers all relevant forms of ownership and control makes the disclosure regime less vulnerable to exploitation by those seeking to abuse the system. A disclosure regime should have a single definition which, at a minimum, (1) specifies that a BO must be a natural person, (2) covers both ownership and control interests, and (3) encompasses both indirect and direct interests. A good definition is likely to combine a catch-all general description of beneficial ownership, complemented by a non-exhaustive list of examples in which these can be held, taking into account the local context.

Using low thresholds to determine ownership or control reduces the risk that someone with relevant ownership or control remains hidden. While extremely low thresholds may become too labour or cost intensive without providing useful insight into significant ownership or control, using thresholds that are too high can create a potential loophole that can be exploited.

Particular consideration should be given to the thresholds that apply to PEPs with ownership or control interests. Lower thresholds may be warranted for PEPs to be disclosed as beneficial owners based on the increased corruption risk associated with them.

Rather than ranges, collecting absolute values when disclosing the percentage of ownership or control assists users in understanding how ownership or control is held. This is particularly important when ownership or control is held indirectly. Where possible, definitions should be harmonised regionally and internationally, or similar minimum standards should be adopted.
