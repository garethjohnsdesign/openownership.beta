BOVS:
  Node: A vertex in a BOVS diagram. Nodes function like nouns, representing Parties.
  Arrow: An edge in a BOVS diagram. Arrows function like verbs, connecting Nodes to show relationships.
  Chain: A series of Nodes continuously connected by Arrows is called a Chain. The "start" of the Chain is the first Node and the "end" is the last, based on the direction of the Arrows.
  Party: General term for any kind of thing (e.g. Person, Company) that can be involved in a beneficial ownership situation.
  Beneficiary: Any Party that has ownership or control of another Party. The Beneficiary at the start of a Chain is the "ultimate" Beneficiary.
  Subject: Any type of Party that cannot be legally owned or controlled (e.g. a Person). Subjects are always the ultimate Beneficiaries, i.e always appear at the start of a Chain.
  Object: Any type of Party that must be legally owned or controlled (e.g. a Company). Objects can appear at any point in a Chain except the start.
  Person: A single private individual.
  Regime: A country, state, or governing body with recognised sovereignty that can own or control Objects.
  Entity: Any legal construction that a Party could have an interest in, such as a Company, Trust, Partnership, Contract, etc.
  Organisation: Any incorporated entity such as a limited company, public company or charity.
  Distance: The Distance between two Nodes is the length of the shortest Chain that connects them. The length of a Chain is the number of Arrows that are present in it. Two parties are 'distant' if the Chain connecting them has a length greater than 1.
  Direct: A Party has a Direct interest in another if the Distance between them is 1. Otherwise the interest is Indirect.
