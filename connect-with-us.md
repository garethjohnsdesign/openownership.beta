legal: We are fiscally sponsored by the [Fund for the City of New York](http://www.fcny.org/fcny/).
  Fiscal sponsorship is a common mechanism in the non-profit sector that enables organizations
  to launch new programs without needing to complete the full process of establishing
  a new legal entity. As we grow, we will be evaluating the best organizational setup.
